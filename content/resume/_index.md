# Resume
### [Download as pdf](/resume/MichaelWallResume.pdf) or [view my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/thewalla07)
## **Summary**
I am a 4th Year Computer Applications student in Dublin City University graduating in 2017.  I am passionate about technology and I learn new skills with speed and relative ease.  I consider myself to be intuitive, creative and focused.  I am always excited to extend the boundaries of my knowledge, and strive to work with like-minded individuals.  My hobbies include making art, writing music and tweaking Linux.

## **Experience**
### **Vocational Intern,** ***SAP SSC (Ireland) Ltd***
#### *2 June 2015 – Present*
I am part of the first 20 students to be selected for this innovative Cooperative Learning program.  I have had two major roles during my time at SAP:

- SAP HANA Support Engineer:  Problem solving application and database issues in SAP HANA; resolving customer problems; creation of Knowledge Base Articles for the use of my team.

- Software Engineer, Business Intelligence R&D:  Working in an agile team using adapted scrum methodologies; new feature development in Java; bug fixing and problem solving; test automation; collaboration with QAs and other developers.

### **Lab Tutor,** ***Dublin City University***
#### *22 Sep 2014 – 29 May 2015*
I was responsible for teaching 12 -15 students (varied by semester) advanced programming concepts to first year students in Java. I tutored for 4 hours a week in semester I and 2 hours a week in semester II. This role is only offered to the top 20 students in the year.

### **Coding Mentor,**  ***CoderDojo***
#### *July 2012 – April 2016*
I volunteered to teach young coders basics in HTML and CSS, and elementary programming concepts with Java. I started there myself as a student, and progressed to mentor a group of 20 – 30 children together with 5 other dojo leaders. They developed their own personal websites and basic games with Python.

### **Projects and programming,** ***[(view some projects)](/projects/)***
#### *2012 – Present*
[Blockchain E-Voting](https://github.com/CPSSD/voting):  Is an implementation of an electronic voting system written in Golang. It makes use of a blockchain structure to tackle the issues of voter anonymity and tamper-proofing ballots. (Final year project; work in progress)

[Massively Distributed File System](https://github.com/CPSSD/MDFS):  Is a CLI program which provides access to a cloud storage like system. Files distribution is handled by a metadata service. Data can be stored securely for users over potentially insecure storage nodes. (Third year project)

[Linux-foo](https://github.com/thewalla07/linux-foo):  Is a set of scripts and programs I have written to make my Linux life easier.

I participated in the Openet Decode programming competition in 2016, and in the Google HashCode competition in 2016 and 2017.
